redux works on the data layer

how we can create redux store

how we can manage data using redux

using redux is not mandatory

for small applications don't need redux

react and redux are different library

redux is used for state managementx

alternative of redux is zustand

when using redux dev tools application becomes easy to debug

2 libraries that redux offers
react redux - bridge between react and redux
redux toolkit - package is standard way to write redux logic

redux store is big whole object and kept in central global place and any component can access this redux store

we can keep our entire data in redux store because redux store has slices

slice is small portion of the redux store

for suppose we create a separate slice for cart data which cart slice

user slice

theme slice

this cart slice will have all the data of the cart

how does the data go to cart slice

we cannot add directly or modify the cart slice

when we click on the add item, it dispatch an action, this action calls a function and the function modify or updates the cart slice

this function is basically known as the reducer

now read data for cart slice

for reading data we use selector to read the data from store and modify the react component

this is subscribe to the store, where if data in store changes my component updates

we subscribe to the store using a selector

install redux tool kit

install react redux

first build our own store in the utils appStore.js

now provide this store to our application

now find the root of the application

and connect the store and root of the application using provider that comes from react-redux and pass the store to the provider as props

now create cart slice using createSlice and we pass configuration like initialstate like initial state of the cart, and then reducers where it can contain additem reducer etc.. which modifies the slice of the cart, reducer gets the access to initial state and also gets access to the action and it will modify the state based on the action

when we click on add item we get payload

now we will export our actions and reducers

now add the slice to the store

store also has a reducer for it and this reducer combines the reducers of these slices

basically a reducer is nothing but which modifies soemthing like slice or store

so slice has its reducers and store has its reducer

we use selector to read from the slice

its a hook

this hook gives access to the store

subsribing to the store using selector

we tell to the selector what portion of the store we need access to

now in itemlist we can add item by clicking add item button ..on click of it we first dispatch an action using useDispatch given by hook
