how to manage data in our application

higher order components

higher order component is a function that takes a component and returns a component

this takes a component and enhances and then returns

UI is different and data part is different in react
 
data layer is very important

all the react applications has UI layer and data layer and UI layer is powered by data layer

data layer is props, state etc..

UI layer is the jsx

we should know more on how to manage data

controlled component and uncontrolled component

lifting the state up



props drilling

data in react flows in one direction from parent to child

so data needs to flow all through all components

so one or two levels passing props fine, lets say we need pass props to more levels, so this is not recommended instead we can use react context

by this we can access data at any place

react context

so using react context we can avoid props drilling

context is like a global place where anyone can access

this context is like a global kind of object for react

using createContext we create the context

in createContext we give the information that we hold

react has usecontext hook using which we can access context

UserContext.provider helps you to override the default context value

we wrapped UserContext.provider in the whole app

thats y all places in the app, the new value will be updated

alternative for context is redux
