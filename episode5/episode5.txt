chapter 5

usestate is used to create state variables

whenever state variable updates, react will re render the component

data layer will be in sync with UI layer

as the state variable updates UI will update by re rendering

react uses something know as reconciliation algorithm and this its also know react fiber

virtual dom is representation of actual dom

virtual dom is nothing but the react element which is a js object

return <body /> here this is virtual dom

diff algorithm is difference between previous virtual dom and new virtual dom

and then diff algorithm updates the actual dom and thats how the react is fast

virtaul dom is nothing but final react element or final jsx that converted to converted to react element by babel and this react element is nothing but js object rendered as html
