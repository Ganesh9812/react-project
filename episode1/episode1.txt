document getelementbyid all those understood by browser
but react is not understood by browser
so to use react get react into the project
first way to add using cdn
cdn is a place where react library is hosted and we are fetching that library and putting in our code
once we place the cdn links, now our project has react inside it

browser does not know react
we need to configure react into our project
browser knows the js as it has the js engine


how can we inject react into the project

CDN content delivery network these are website where react library is hoisted and we are pulling the react from there and using in our project

first file react.development.js this is the core file of the react
second file react-dom.development.js for dom for browsers...

react works in phone apps as react native

root is the place where we render everything

End of the day react uses js
end of the day react is just js piece of code

const heading = React.createElement

this heading is the react element this is nothign but normal js object
