chapter 7

useeffect callback function will be called after every render of that component

dependency array changes the behaviour of the useeffect render

if we dont put any dependency arry, useeffect will be rendered after every render

if empty depenency array, then useeffect will be call only once after the initial render

if you put something in the dependency array, then useeffect will be called when the dependency changes

createBrowserRouter will create a routing configuration for us

we can also put error page using errorElement

also for the error component we can use useRouteError

also we can create child routing where like we need to keep header in common in which ever page we go

in header links, better not use <a> tag for links as it will reload the entire page, so link from react router dom

2 types of routing
client side routing
server side routing

server side routing --- when you click on some link, page reloads and make a network call orrequest goes to server to fetch the html and then renders
client side routing- here we are not making any network calls and just components changed

dynamic routing

generally useeffect is called after every render
if [] then called only after initial render
if something in dependency array then definitely called after initial render and then called every time my dependency array changes

do not create usestate outside the function component
its used for creating the local state variables for the component
better create usestate at the start
dont create usestate inside if else


create router configuration in app.js

react router dom gives an hook called useRouteError

this is the page redirection in terms of url


now in header we click on the link, it should go to the respective page
in react dont use a tag for the links
because the page will refresh 
in react we can go the page without reloading the page 
use link from react-router-dom
link component works same as a tag and it does not load the page and redirect to the page needed
instead of href we give to 


useparam
