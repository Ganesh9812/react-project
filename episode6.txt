all the big companies are preferring micro services archetiture

micro serives together forms a project

different teams can work on different services independently and these serives interact with each other

all the servies run on their own port

and each service can maintain individual git rub

loads -->api call ---> render  ui
loads _--> render skeleton --> api data

in react we always follows second
react has the best render mechanism

useeffect hook
hook is a normal js function which react give to us with specific usecase
useeffect callback function will be called after the component renders
oncer body is rendered and once render is done, then callback function is called

breakpoint added, so that code gets executed only before the breakpoint and will not come to breakpoint

useeffect callback function will be called after the component renders

once the page body renders for the first time when you open the page, after the render, then effect callback will be called

whenever the state variable changes, then the component will re render
